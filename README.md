### Description <a class="anchor" id="description"></a>

"Personal website V2" aims to create V2 of my website. 

### Context <a class="anchor" id="context"></a>

The V1 of my website is very simple. When I created it, I had just a basic knowledge
of HTML and CSS, and even if I implemented JS and PHP files, I created them from YT tutorials without 
knowing exactly how they worked.

So, and after acquiring new skills and knowledge thanks to my academic training, I decided to improve
my website and create a V2.

### V2 Proposal <a class="anchor" id="proposition"></a>

This new version contains five main sections:
- Story (About me)
- Portfolio (GitHub repositories)
- Read (what I have read)
- Videos (YT videos)
- Contact form (form)

In addition to, there will be a home page with links to these sections.

Concerning difference between V1 and V2, you can find in table here below some features implemented 
on V1 and what I want to implement on V2 :

|  #  | Technology | Features on V1 | Features for V2 |
|:---:|:----------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
|  1  |    HTML    |       -        | Improved syntax |
|  2  |    CSS     |     JQuery     |     JQuery      |
|  3  |            |       -        |       BEM       |
|  4  |     JS     |    Arrow up    |    Arrow up     |
|  5  |            |       -        |    Carrousel    |
|  6  |            |       -        |   Pagination    |
|  7  |            |       -        |      Modal      |
|  8  |            |       -        |       POO       |
|  9  |            |       -        |    API fetch    |
| 10  |    PHP     |  Contact form  |  Contact form   |

I decided not use Django Framework because my host does not accepte it. For that, I will need 
to change my current subscription.

Also, I would like to improve my knowledge of CSS. Because of that, I will not implement a 
framework as Bootstrap, but a methodology as BEM.

Finally, I pretend to have an approach Domain Driven Design (DDD) in order to focus on domains 
(sections) of my website. That's why I think implement models (POO) for every section:

| Domains (section) | Models  |
|:-----------------:|:-------:|
|       Story       | Chapter |
|     Portfolio     | Project |
|       Read        |  Book   |
|      Videos       |  Video  |
|   Contact form    |  Form   |

## Management and progress <a class="anchor" id="management"></a>

In order to manage this project, I divide it in three main phases:
- Phase 1: Implemented index pages and base template.
- Phase 2: Implemented sections "story" and "portfolio".
- Phase 3: Implemented sections "read" and "videos".

When phases 1 and 2 will have concluded, I will send project in production.

You can find the progress of every phase in link here below:

Also, I implemented user stories for every phase. 
You can find the progress of user stories in link here below:

Finally, a kanban was implemented to know status of every user story.
